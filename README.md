# Project Overview

This project is a workflow-based system that utilizes various agents to analyze and provide insights on stock market data. The system is built using the Llama Index framework and leverages the Google GenAI model for natural language processing.

# Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or later
* [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
* Google GenAI API credentials (obtainable through the Google Cloud Console)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dobraga/ai-investor`
2. Install dependencies: `uv sync`
3. Set up Google GenAI API credentials
4. [Set up AlhaVantage API credential](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)
5. Create a new file named `.env` in the project root directory
   
```.env
ALPHA_VANTAGE=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
```

# Usage

### Running the Workflow

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the workflow using the following command: `uv run src/`

### Available Agents

The following agents are currently available:

* Warren Buffett Agent
* Ray Dalio Agent
* Peter Lynch Agent
* Cathie Wood Agent
* Fundamentalist Agent
* Risk Manager Agent
* Signal Agent

## Agent Architecture

The investment analysis process follows a structured workflow involving multiple specialized agents:

1.  **Initial Input:** The process begins with a stock ticker symbol provided as input.
2.  **Parallel Analysis by Investor Agents:** The ticker is simultaneously processed by the following Investor Agents, each with a distinct focus:
    *   **Cathie Wood Agent:** Analyzes based on disruptive innovation and high-growth potential.
    *   **Fundamentalist Agent:** Focuses on the core financial health and intrinsic value of the company.
    *   **Peter Lynch Agent:** Looks for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) and businesses that are easy to understand.
    *   **Ray Dalio Agent:** Assesses financial health, resilience, and alignment with broad economic principles.
    *   **Warren Buffett Agent:** Employs value investing principles, focusing on long-term fundamentals and economic moats.
3.  **Signal Generation:** Each Investor Agent independently performs its analysis and generates a `SignalEvent`. This event encapsulates:
    *   **Detailed Reasoning:** A thorough explanation of the factors influencing their assessment.
    *   **Confidence Score:** A numerical value (typically 0-100) indicating the agent's confidence in its analysis.
    *   **Final Verdict:** A clear recommendation, such as "Strong Candidate," "Hold," or "Avoid."
4.  **Signal Aggregation:** The `SignalEvent` objects generated by all active Investor Agents are collected.
5.  **Risk Assessment and Consolidation:** The aggregated signals are then passed to the `Risk Manager Agent`.
6.  **Final Decision:** The `Risk Manager Agent` critically evaluates all received signals. It considers the reasoning and confidence scores from each Investor Agent, performs its own comprehensive risk assessment, and then produces a final, consolidated investment decision along with an overall confidence score. This output represents the system's collective judgment on the stock.
