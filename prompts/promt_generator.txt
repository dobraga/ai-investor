1. In the final prompt list all metrics listed above and add a rule used to make a decision (like Sell only if fundamentals deteriorate or valuation far exceeds intrinsic value)
2. confidence(0-100) score for this decision
3. ensure the prompt force to have reasoning for each metric above to give a verdict
4. a final verdict ["Strong Candidate", "Possible Candidate", "Not a Typical Investment", "Avoid"]
