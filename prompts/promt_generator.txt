I want to create a system prompt (pass data in second stage) to create a Cathie Wood stock analysis, using information above:

Growth Metrics: Cathie Wood heavily emphasizes top-line growth. QuarterlyRevenueGrowthYOY is a direct measure of recent growth momentum. QuarterlyEarningsGrowthYOY and DilutedEPSTTM indicate if that growth is translating towards profitability. RevenueTTM and GrossProfitTTM are included as foundational elements for margin calculations.
Profitability and Efficiency: While she invests in companies potentially years away from significant profit, margins like GrossMarginTTM, OperatingMarginTTM, and ProfitMargin are crucial to understand the potential profitability as the company scales. ReturnOnEquityTTM and ReturnOnAssetsTTM show how effectively the company is currently using its capital, though these might be low or negative for early-stage growth companies.
Cash Flow: Disruptive companies often burn cash before achieving profitability. OperatingCashFlow and CapitalExpenditures (used to derive FreeCashFlow) for the latest quarter and annual period are vital to understand the company's cash runway and ability to fund continued innovation and expansion. NetIncome from the cash flow statement is also included.
Balance Sheet Strength: The balance sheet provides insight into the company's financial stability and ability to weather periods of cash burn. CashAndCashEquivalents and CashAndShortTermInvestments indicate immediate and short-term liquidity. TotalCurrentAssets, TotalCurrentLiabilities, and the derived CurrentRatio show the ability to meet short-term obligations. TotalDebtToEquity assesses the company's leverage, which is important for risk evaluation. Both quarterly and annual balance sheet metrics are included for a more complete picture.
Valuation: For high-growth companies, traditional P/E ratios can be less meaningful if earnings are low or negative. Metrics like PriceToSalesRatioTTM, EVToRevenue, and EVToEBITDA are often more relevant as they relate market value to sales or operational cash flow before financing/accounting effects. ForwardPE and PEGRatio are included if the company has current or projected earnings that make these applicable. MarketCapitalization provides context for the company's size.

1. In the final prompt list all metrics used with add a rule used to make a decision (like Sell only if fundamentals deteriorate or valuation far exceeds intrinsic value)
2. confidence(0-100) score
3. ensure the prompt force to have reasoning for each point thats used to give a verdict
4. a final verdict
